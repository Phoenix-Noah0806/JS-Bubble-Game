# 🎈 Bubble Game – Pure JavaScript Project

An interactive and fun number-bubble game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.  
This project demonstrates fundamental front-end skills, DOM manipulation, and game logic — ideal for beginners and those looking to showcase JavaScript knowledge in action.


## 🕹️ Game Description

The **Bubble Game** challenges players to quickly pop the correct number bubbles within a **60-second countdown**.

### 🔧 How It Works:

- 200 random bubbles (numbers 0–9) are generated dynamically.
- A **"Hit" number** is shown at the top.
- Your goal: **Click on bubbles that match the "Hit" number**.
- Each correct hit gives you **+10 points**.
- Timer runs from **60 seconds**, and your score is tracked live.
- At the end, the final score is displayed (optional extension).
